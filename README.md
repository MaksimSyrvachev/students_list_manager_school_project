# students_list_manager_school_project
This is an other one school project for C++ lessons, which represents student list management.

# launching the project
It is console application, so you can run it directly.

After running the project can see the menu with different choices. By pressing `1` you can enter student data from keyboard by yourself or read from already existing file.
Then you can manage added list, for example modify student's data, delete any student, calculate student's grades, sort this list by last name and save hole list with students to text file.
I wrote my project on the principle of OOP. So, it was my final project in C++ course.
